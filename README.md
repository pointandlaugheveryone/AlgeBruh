This is a project I did to learn to make GUI apps, which ended up way more complex than I expected.
I refactored the first code completely and tried to make it actually usable and easier to add other functions in the future. 
(which I probably will not do honestly)

Currently, it utilises the shunting yard algorithm to enable copy-pasting mathematical expressions and validate parentheses.

The UI is still in progress.
