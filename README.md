**This is a learning project gone wild.**\
aka basic calculator with some bugs

Its the first UI thing I've ever made, so I will keep this public for reasons

I used the shunting yard algorithm to enable copy-pasting mathematical expressions and validate parentheses.

The UI is build with AvaloniaUI\
Not all buttons are there but the functions (e.g. parentheses) work.
