This is a learning project gone wild.
I refactored the first code completely and tried to make it actually usable and easier to add other functions in the future. 
(which I probably will not do honestly)
However, it's still the first GUI thing I've ever made, so I will keep this public.

Currently, it utilises the shunting yard algorithm to enable copy-pasting mathematical expressions and validate parentheses.

The UI is build with AvaloniaUI to be platform agnostic and is still in progress. (read unfunctional)
